## Description

A standalone PHP class provides a wrapper around the PubMed API. Fully documented with working examples.

- Access PubMed through a proxy server programatically
- Limit the total number of search results
- Pagination splits search results amoung multiple pages
- Optional exact search term matching
- Cache search results as JSON formatted text files
- Load search results from cache
- Control lifetime of cache results

## Documentation

To get started:

    include('PubMedAPI.php');
    $search_term = 'search query';
    $PubMedAPI = new PubMedAPI();
    $results = $PubMedAPI->query($search_term);

The `query()` method returns an array of search results or an empty array if no matches were found.

Interaction with the PubMed API is accomplished in two steps. Given a search term, the first query returns a list of PMIDs. The second query returns the metadata of each article. `query()` takes three arguments, the first is the search term string (this can also be the PMID if already known), the second is a boolean that returns a compact result if `TRUE`, and the third is an optional callback function to manipulate the results.

Returns the pmid, volume, issue, year, month, day, pages, issn, journal, journalabbrev, title, abstract, affiliation, authors, articleid, keywords of each article.

Refer to the class file for more documentation.
